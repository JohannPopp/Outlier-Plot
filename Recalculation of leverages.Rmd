This code recalculates leverages based on formula 5.12 from Hosmer et al 2013[^1] to reproduce figure 5.12 from the same source. It also calcultates leveraged based given the formula of Stata[^2] which was used to draw the graphs for Hosmer et al 2013.  

```{r}
# Example data
glow <- aplore3::glow500

# Recode RATERISK
glow$raterisk3 <- cut(as.numeric(glow$raterisk), 2)
levels(glow$raterisk3) <- c("less/same", "greater")


# Logistic model from Table 4.16
model <- glm(fracture ~ age + height + priorfrac + momfrac + 
               armassist + raterisk3 + age:priorfrac + momfrac:armassist, 
             data = glow, family = "binomial")

# convert to covariate pattern

# Indicator for covariate patterns
datN$cpID <- apply(datN[,-1], 1, function(x) paste(x, collapse = ""))
cp$cpID <- apply(cp, 1, function(x) paste(x, collapse = ""))

# Size of covariate patterns
cp$m <- tapply(datN[,1], datN$cpID, length)[rank(cp$cpID)]

# Number of cases per covariate pattern
cp$Y <- tapply(model$y, datN$cpID, sum)[rank(cp$cpID)]

# Estimated probability
cp$P <- fitted.values(model)[rownames(cp)]

# Leverage

# Diagonal of variances
V <- diag(cp$m * cp$P * (1 - cp$P))

# Design matrix
X <- unique(model.matrix(model)) # This makes the difference to epiR::epi.cpresids

H <- V^(1/2) %*% X %*% solve(t(X) %*% V %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% (V^(1/2))
h <- diag(H)

# Leverage based on Stata formula

# Extract variance-covariance matrix from the model
V2 <- vcov(model)
# Calculate the raw hat values

h2 <- rawH * cp$m * cp$P * (1-cp$P)

       legend = c("Photograph of Fig. 5.12 in\nHosmer et al. 2013",

This fits perfectly with the original graph. Leverages based on formula 5.12 from Hosmer et al (wich is taken from Pregibon 1981[^2]) are exactly the same as those based on the Stata formula.
