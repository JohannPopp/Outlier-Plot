# Outlier-Plot
Creating outlier plots for logistic regression

The code produces plots for diagnosis of outliers in logistic regression as recomended by Hosmer et al 2013. A brush function hightlights data points that are selected in one of these plots in all the other plots. 

So far this is realized with ggvis.
